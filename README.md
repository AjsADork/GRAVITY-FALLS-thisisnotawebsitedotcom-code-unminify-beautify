## Introduction to repository  
Hello! As a fellow Gravity falls enthusiest, I started thinking. What if gravity falls put any hidden messages in their website? 

Well I saved the HTML/CSS/JS to my computer to analyze the files and they were all formated through "minification" (bare with me im learning). 
So I took the time to un-do this process to make it readable. Not everything may be correct if there are any mistakes let me know, this is my first github repository I have ever posted so I am very new to this as well.
