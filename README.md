## Introduction to Repository   
Hello! As a fellow Gravity falls enthusiest, I started thinking. What if gravity falls put any hidden messages in their website? 

Well I saved the HTML/CSS/JS to my computer to analyze the files and they were all formated through "minification" (bare with me im learning). 
So I took the time to un-do this process to make it readable. Not everything may be correct if there are any mistakes let me know, this is my first github Repository I have ever posted so I am very new to this as well.

In this repository, I have included the CSS and JavaScript code from the website thisisnotawebsitedotcom.com, which I unminified and reformatted using BeautifyTools for better readability. However, I chose not to include the HTML as it was already correctly formatted on the website and did not require any beautification or modification. If anyone wishes to view the HTML, they can easily access it directly from the website itself. I want to emphasize that I am not claiming ownership of any of this code, as it belongs to the original website's owners. This repository is purely for educational purposes to allow others to read and analyze the code. If there are any legal concerns, including copyright or other rights associated with the code, please notify me, and I will take down the repository if requested. This repository does not modify the code's functionality but is provided as-is in its beautified form. Please refer to the website for any official use or licensing terms.
